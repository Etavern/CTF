# CMD+CTRL

CMD+CTRL by [Security Innovation](https://www.securityinnovation.com/) is probably not your typical CTF. There is an instance of a vulnerable website with no end goal, other than breaking whatever you can. There is no need to enter the flag, because as soon as you discover the vulnerability (e.g. trigger XSS), you instantly get the points.

The topics include:
- Data tampering
- Ciphers
- SQLi
- XSS
- Hash cracking

Because there are so many flags in place (I have captured 70 and those are not all) and some of them are repetitive, I did not write down everything I did. That said, here are the outlines of some key challenges from the CTF.
